# glfw4bun

*glfw4bun* is a [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) binding for [Bun](https://bun.sh/) autogenerated with makebindingsforbun.

*glfw4bun* is experimental, but working.

## Autogeneration

To use this package you don't need to autogenerate the bindings, as they are already included.

However, if you want to regenerate them, use:

`
makebindingsforbun glfw_binding_config.json
`
