# glfw4bun

*glfw4bun* is a [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) binding for [Bun](https://bun.sh/) autogenerated with [makebindingsforbun](https://github.com/davidmanzanares/makebindingsforbun).

*glfw4bun* is experimental, but working.

## Autogeneration

To use this package you don't need to autogenerate the bindings, as they are already included.

However, if you want to regenerate them, use:

`
makebindingsforbun glfw_binding_config.json
`

## Example

See [vulkan_bun_helloworld](https://github.com/davidmanzanares/vulkan_bun_helloworld)
